      "- Repayment History: A credit score of 720 indicates a strong history of timely payments and responsible debt management, demonstrating a reliable financial character.\n",
      "- Financial Behavior: A healthy pre-loan Debt-to-Income ratio of 0.28 and the successful management of an existing mortgage highlight prudent financial habits and a commitment to obligations.\n",
      "- Trustworthiness: 60 months (5 years) of stable employment in a full-time capacity, coupled with no recent adverse personal events, reflects high reliability and a stable personal life.\n",
