## 📊 Features

### Core Components

1. **Machine Learning Pipeline**
   - Pre-trained model (`recommender_model.joblib`)
   - Handles 25+ features including demographics, financial behavior, and loan details
   - Generates baseline credit scores

2. **AI-Powered Assessment**
   - Google Gemini 2.5 Pro integration

### Scoring Categories

The system evaluates creditworthiness across five key areas:

| Category | Weight | Focus Areas |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Payment History** | 30% | Payment patterns, defaults, late payments |
